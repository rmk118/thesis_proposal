Special focus will be placed on understanding the methodologies of studies that have investigated regional/spatial variation in size at maturity. I will aim to follow current best practices for ensuring transparency and reproducibility in ecological systematic reviews and meta-analyses [@foo2021; @odea2021; @kambouris2024; @gates2002].\n\n## Completed work\n\n### Formulate initial question and identify inclusion/exclusion criteria\n\n-   What methods have previously been used to model crustacean size at maturity based on morphometric data?\n-   How have previous studies represented spatial variation in size at maturity within a given species?\n-   How accurate and precise are these methods?\n\nSince the focus of this review does not fit well into the PICO framework, I have used the SPIDER framework to organize the key components of the research question [@methley2014] (@tbl-spider).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-spider .cell tbl-cap='Inclusion criteria in the SPIDER framework.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{tabular*}{\\linewidth}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lll}\n\\toprule\nletter & word & description \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nS & Sample & Crustacean species \\\\ \nPI & Phenomenon of Interest & Identifying size at sexual maturity based on changes in a morphometric relationship (e.g., the ratio between carapace width and claw height) \\\\ \nD & Design & Measured at least two morphological features, then used a computational/algorithmic approach to estimate size at morphometric maturity \\\\ \nE & Evaluation & A numerical estimate of SM50 or conclusion about the utility of morphometric analysis for determining size at maturity \\\\ \nR & Research Type & Quantitative \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular*}\n\\end{table}\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Exclusion criteria:]{.underline}\n\n-   Studies that did not attempt to estimate size at maturity or identify maturity-related changes in allometric growth\n    -   Studies that used existing size cutoffs (e.g., 30mm CW) or discriminant functions for classification\n-   Studies that only estimate size at gonadal/sexual maturity (no morphometric ratios considered)\n-   Studies that focused on a non-crustacean species\n-   Studies written in a language other than English\n\n### Execute search\n\nTo identify the most appropriate citation databases to use for this review, I consulted several studies comparing the academic search systems commonly used for evidence synthesis [@visser2021; @haddaway2015; @martín-martín2021; @gusenbauer2019; @gusenbauer2020]. Based on the overlap between the databases recommended for use by these studies and the databases to which I have institutional access, I decided to use Scopus, JSTOR, and ProQuest. Although the merits of Google Scholar as a tool for systematic reviews may be somewhat contentious [@boeker2013; @giustini2013], it contains many records that are not found in other databases and is a powerful tool to find grey literature and increase the coverage of multi-database searches [@haddaway2015; @gusenbauer2019; @martín-martín2021]. I only included the first 500 results out of 686 returned from Google Scholar (the first 25 pages). This is beyond the threshold of 50-100 results included by many systematic reviewers [@haddaway2015], and results beyond that appeared to have low relevance to the focal question. I also searched the NOAA Institutional Repository, another excellent source of grey literature, and did preliminary searches of Github and Zenodo to identify code/software developed for size at maturity modeling. Additionally, many additional relevant sources were identified through snowball searching and while reading scientific articles and management documents (e.g., stock assessment reports) (@tbl-databases).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-databases .cell tbl-cap='Databases used for systematic review'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{tabular*}{\\linewidth}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lrll}\n\\toprule\nDatabase & \\# of results & Search field & Notes \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nJSTOR & 33 & Abstracts only &  \\\\ \nScopus & 332 & Abstract, title, keywords &  \\\\ \nProQuest & 49 & Anywhere but full text & ProQuest One Academic (includes ProQuest Central and ProQuest Dissertation \\& Theses Global.

The query used for all other databases was: (morpho\\* AND \"maturity\" AND \"size\") AND (\"crab\" OR \"Crustacea\" OR \"Decapoda\" OR \"Brachyura\"). The search string was tested with a preliminary Scopus search to ensure that it could find two articles that were highly relevant to the project: Olsen and Stevens [-@olsen2020] and Lawrence et al. [-@lawrence2021].\n\nDuplicates were first removed using the duplicate merging feature in the reference manager software Zotero. A second round of duplicate screening was conducted using the online systematic review software Rayyan, which was then used for the initial screening of titles and abstracts. In some cases, the full text was briefly skimmed to resolve uncertainties about whether the study should be included that resulted from absent or ambiguous descriptions in the abstract of the method of determining size at maturity. The primary reason for exclusion was that the study determined physiological or functional maturity rather than morphometric maturity [@waiho2017]. Another common category of excluded studies were those using morphometric analysis for a purpose other than determining size at maturity, such as to distinguish two species, compare populations within a species, or identify the biological effects of an external variable like temperature or predation. At least 70 studies were focused on the general morphology and/or size at maturity of a non-crustacean organism, particularly skates, rays, and marine snails.\n\nA small number of studies were excluded because they were written in a language other than English. Although not considering non-English studies can introduce bias into systematic reviews, some authors have found excluding non-English papers has a minimal effect on the overall conclusions of evidence syntheses [@vickers1998; @nussbaumer-streit2020; @jüni2002]. Additionally, one of the major arguments against excluding non-English studies is that it skews the geographical provenance of the body of evidence under consideration towards Europe and North America [@walpole2019]. The \\>500 English studies retained for future screening represented a wide geographic distribution, and nearly all non-English studies were conducted in a region already represented by multiple English studies.\n\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n",
