"1","ca_w","Carapace width, not otherwise specified."
"2","long_ca_w","Long carapace width: maximum carapace width including spines"
"3","short_ca_w","Short carapace width: maximum carapace width excluding spines. Measurements of internal carapace width are assumed to be of this type."
"4","ca_len","Carapace length, not otherwise specified."
"5","long_ca_len","Long carapace length: distance from the tips of the two frontal teeth to the extreme posterior margin of the carapace, excluding curvature of the carapace."
"6","short_ca_len","Short carapace length: distance from the base of the two frontal teeth to the extreme posterior margin of the carapace, excluding curvature of the carapace."
"7","fo_w","Fronto-orbital width: distance between the outer angles of the orbits."
"8","f_w","Frontal width: distance across the portion of the carapace between but not including the orbital area."
"9","ab_w","Abdomen width, not otherwise specified."
"10","ab_w2","Width of 2nd abdominal segment"
"11","ab_w3","Width of 3rd abdominal segment"
"12","ab_w4","Width of 4th abdominal segment"

"19","cheliped_w","Cheliped width, not otherwise specified."
"20","cp_len","Chela propodus (=manus) length. Distance from the tip of the propodus (sometimes tip of dactyl) to the articulation with the carpus. If not otherwise specified, chela/claw length is assumed to refer to this."

"24","merus_len","Merus length, variously defined. Wallace (1949): Measured on a diagonal from the most posterior dorsal point of articulation of merus and carpus to the most anterior dorsal margin of articulation between the merus and preceding segment, whereas Finney (1981) measured on a straight line, not diagonal."
"25","merus_w","Merus width, variously defined."
