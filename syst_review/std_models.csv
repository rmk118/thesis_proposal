"1","BSL","Broken-stick model with logistic transition","Yes","No","Yes",NA
"2","CLASS","Separate linear regression lines fit to already-classified points","Varies","Varies","Varies","- CLASS-INT: intersection of regression lines
- CLASS-SEP: separate lines not specified to intersect
- CLASS-LOG: if overlap b/w two lines, used logistic regression to find breakpoint"
"3","CLU","Clustering (without discriminant analysis)",NA,NA,"Yes (indirectly)","Includes kmeans, pam, hkmeans, dbscan, hdbscan, mixture models, etc."
"4","CM","Cubic",NA,NA,"No",NA
"5","DIS","Discriminant analysis",NA,NA,"Yes (indirectly)","Includes LDA and QDA. Can be preceded by PCA (principle component analysis = principal factor analysis = major axis regression) and/or preceded by any clustering method."
"6","DID","distribution interval derived (DID) maturity cutline","No",NA,"Yes (indirectly)","Richar & Foy (2022)"

"8","INFL_PT","Based on inflection point or dividing line between frequency modes of a CH/CW ratio histogram",NA,NA,"Yes (indirectly)",NA
"9","INT","Intersecting","Yes","No","No, intersection is SMM","Two separate lines are plotted for known mature and known immature individuals (like with Somerton method), and t-test used to compare slopes b/w lines. If slopes diff, SM50 is taken to be the intersection of the two lines."
