    "text": "1.1 Summary\nAccurate estimates of size at maturity are crucial for the effective management of marine crustaceans, which represent the most valuable group of wild-capture fisheries by landed mass. Size at maturity values often influence the establishment of minimum landing sizes and represent crucial inputs in widely-used stock assessment models. For many crustaceans, size at maturity can be observed through changes in the relative size and growth of the chelae (males) or abdomen (females), referred to as a transition to morphometric maturity. Morphometric maturity is often a better indicator of functional maturity (i.e., the ability to successfully mate and produce offspring) than physiological maturity, which generally must be determined through gonad dissection or similarly invasive methods. Over the past century, various methods have been developed to estimate size at morphometric maturity for hundreds of crustacean species across the globe. Despite their widespread use, there has been limited research comparing the accuracy of these methods, and many researchers are unaware of more recently developed approaches to modeling size at maturity using morphometric data. My proposed thesis will address these gaps by comprehensively evaluating all documented approaches to modeling size at morphometric maturity and developing tools to facilitate the adoption of sound quantitative methods by fisheries scientists and managers.",

Chapter 1 will focus on identifying the modeling approaches (e.g., various types of piecewise regression and clustering) used to estimate size at maturity and will examine the context in which they are applied and the conclusions drawn from the given application. Chapter 2 will use the comprehensive dataset compiled in Chapter 1 to identify how changes in morphometry may be correlated with the life history traits, ecological niches, and evolutionary trajectories of different crustacean species. Chapter 3 will use simulation testing to evaluate the performance of the models identified in Chapter 1 when applied to artificial datasets with known size at maturity values. The simulation testing will allow me to determine how accurately each model can recover the true parameters when presented with realistic challenges like small sample sizes, underrepresentation of smaller individuals, and high variability/error in the data.\nChapter 4 describes an open-source R package I am developing that will contain easy-to-implement functions for researchers to implement the modeling approaches identified and tested in the previous chapters. Finally, the Applications section will demonstrate the value of this research by using the best practices I identify in Chapter 3 to model size at maturity for specific crustacean species. At a minimum, this will include a chapter modeling spatial variation in Jonah crab (Cancer borealis) size at maturity, illustrating how the workflows discussed under the Quantitative Methods heading can be extended to incorporate spatially-structured or time series data.

    "section": "\n1.3 Morphometric Size at Maturity - Background",
    "text": "1.3 Morphometric Size at Maturity - Background\n\n1.3.1 Types of Maturity\nCrustaceans grow in a series of discrete steps by molting, a complex process controlled by the endocrine system during which the animal sheds its entire exoskeleton (ecdysis). Growth can typically be divided into two phases, immature and mature, each of which consists of a number of instars (molts) (McLay 2015). The immature and mature phases are often separated by a “puberty molt” that includes distinct morphological changes and after which the crustacean is sexually mature (Hartnoll 2001). There are several different types of sexual maturity in crustaceans (Box 1, reviewed in Waiho et al., 2017). There is widespread inconsistency in the terminology used to describe the different types of crustacean maturity, which in some instances has prevented accurate size-at-maturity estimates and inhibited effective fishery management (Waddy and Aiken 2005).\nFemale sexual maturity is often relatively easy to visually assess via the presence of embryos or eggs, the presence of sperm or sperm plugs in the seminal receptacle, differences in ovary color and size, and/or obvious changes in abdomen morphology. However, determining male maturity based on primary reproductive characteristics (e.g., examination of the vas deferens) can be more challenging. An increase in the relative size of the abdomen for females and the relative size of the claw for males when crustaceans reach sexual maturity has been recognized for over a century (Huxley 1924; Templeman 1935).\nMorphometric maturity is preferable over physiological maturity for fisheries management purposes, because in many cases individuals may have mature gonads but are incapable of mating (are not “functionally mature”) because they have not developed the necessary secondary sexual characteristics. Functional maturity, the ability of an individual to successfully produce offspring, is the most directly related to the reproductive potential of a population and is therefore considered the most important for management purposes. To provide additional clarity, some authors refer to the transition to functional maturity as “onset of breeding” and restrict “onset of maturity” for references to the development of primary (physiological) or secondary (morphological) sexual characteristics (Montgomery 1992). Although both physiological and functional maturity are commonly used to estimate SM50, the criteria used to identify immature and mature reproductive phases often has a major impact on the estimated parameters (Reed et al. 2023).\nThe difference between physiological and morphometric maturity is perhaps most evident when considering the snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio), in which males mature in three stages: “immature” males lack spermatophores, “adolescent” males have spermatophores but undifferentiated chelae, and “mature” males have both spermatophores and differentiated chelae (Sainte-Marie, Raymond, and Brêthes 1995).\n\n1.3.2 Types of Allometric Growth in Crustaceans\nMuch of the growth that occurs through molting is isometric, meaning that various parts of the body are increasing in size by the same amount and thus remaining proportionate. The disproportionate growth of body parts is called allometric growth and often occurs for secondary sexual characteristics, most notably for the chelipeds of male crustaceans and the abdomen of females. Although I will focus specifically on allometry (changes in relative size or growth), shape-based morphometry using morphological landmarks can similarly be used to identify the onset of sexual maturity in crustaceans (Collins, Giri, and Williner 2008).\nThere are three kinds of allometric growth: ontogenetic allometry, static allometry, and phylogenetic allometry (Figure 1.1) (Gould 1971). When \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are traits measured in the same individual through developmental time, the relationship is called an ontogenetic allometry. When they are measured in different individuals at the same developmental stage within a population or species it is called static allometry.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Types of allometry. (A) Ontogenetic allometry. (B) Static allometry. (C) Phylogenetic allometry\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between ontogenetic and static allometry, after Shingleton (2010). Thin grey lines represent individual growth trajectories (the relationship between body and claw size within the development of a single individual). The final body and claw sizes (blue dots) combine to form the allometry of size for the population (the thick black line).\n\n\n\nAll three types of allometry in one figure. After Neiro (n.d.). Different shapes represent three different crustacean species.\n\nGrowth patterns often change upon reaching maturity due to increased energy allocation towards reproduction, meaning that biphasic growth models are more accurate than those that do not differentiate between pre- and post-maturation growth (Quince et al. 2008; Minte-Vera et al. 2016). Within the broad paradigm of crustacean growth, there exists a tremendous diversity of growth patterns. The first major factor distinguishing these growth scenarios is the presence or absence of a terminal molt. For species that exhibit indeterminate growth, molting continues until death, whereas determinate growth is said to occur when a crustacean enters “terminal anecdysis” after the last molt (often the puberty molt) and can no longer grow or repair bodily damage by molting. An extreme example of how growth changes at maturity can be found in crustacean species like the snow crab that have a terminal molt to maturity, meaning that growth ceases once an individual becomes mature (Conan and Comeau 1986).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious possible biphasic growth patterns in Crustacea. After McLay (2015).\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible growth patterns depicted on a log-log scale, where the x-axis is body size and the y-axis is the size of the body part that exhibits allometric growth.",

Accurate estimates of size at maturity are crucial for the sustainable management of these valuable fisheries.\nSize at maturity is a key consideration when setting minimum size regulations, as setting a minimum legal size below the size at 50% sexual maturity (SM50) can significantly restrict the reproductive potential of a population. When minimum size limits are set above SM50, high yield and spawning biomass can often be maintained even under high fishing pressure (Prince and Hordyk 2019).",

    "text": "2.2 Stock assessment & model inputs\nEffective management of crustacean fisheries depends on stock assessments that estimate current biomass levels, evaluate the health of the stock compared to historical levels, and predict the effects of potential management actions. The difficulty of aging crustaceans means that size-structured models are typically preferred over age-based methods for stock assessment purposes (Punt, Huang, and Maunder 2013; Punt, Haddon, and McGarvey 2016). SM50 is a fundamental parameter in frequently used stock assessment models like Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LBSPR), which are especially useful for data-limited fisheries (Prince and Hordyk 2019; Hordyk et al. 2015). Stock assessment models can be highly sensitive to shifts in size at maturity inputs like SM50, particularly when combined with changes in growth parameters such as molt probability and molt increment probability (Hodgdon et al. 2022). Understanding the effect that climate-driven shifts in life history input parameters like SM50 have on stock assessment model outputs is critical for future modeling efforts and fisheries management (Hodgdon et al. 2022).\nEven when temporal variation in maturity does not have a dominant impact on assessment output, uncertainty in maturity estimates can be a significant contributor to overall uncertainty in biomass estimates (Miller, O’Brien, and Fratantoni 2018). This underscores the importance of morphometric maturity modeling approaches that provide reliable estimates of the uncertainty associated with the resulting SM50 values.",

For example, there is strong evidence that size-based fishery selection has led to declines in female SM50 for female American lobster (Homarus americanus) in the United States and Canada (Haarr et al. 2018; Waller et al. 2019, 2021; Le Bris et al. 2017).",

    "text": "2.5 Climate impacts\nShifts in ocean conditions have already led to shifts in the abundance and spatial distribution of important marine fisheries, with resulting impacts on their productivity (Cheung, Watson, and Pauly 2013; Nye et al. 2009). Consequently, understanding the effects of climate change on marine resources and identifying effective mitigation strategies are key priorities of the NOAA Fisheries National Climate Science Strategy.\nDelaying revisions to harvest regulations in response to climate-related changes in population growth rates can increase the likelihood of a population collapse (Brown et al. 2012; Pershing et al. 2015). Conversely, dynamic biological reference points and responsive harvest control rules can increase the climate resilience of a fishery (Collie et al. 2021; Kritzer et al. 2019). Identifying and refining non-invasive, relatively inexpensive methods of monitoring size at maturity and other life history traits dictating reproductive potential will support the dynamic and adaptive fisheries management needed to offset the negative effects of climate change (Karp et al. 2019; Gaines et al. 2018; Holsman et al. 2019).\nKnowledge of the direction and magnitude of climate-related shifts in size at maturity is essential for simulating the effects of alternative minimum size limits under various warming scenarios (Hunt et al. 2023).\nNOAA Fisheries Climate Vulnerability Assessments identify which species may be most vulnerable based on their exposure to projected environmental changes and their ability to cope with those changes given their specific life history characteristics. Of the crustaceans included in the Northeast Fish and Shellfish Climate Vulnerability Assessment (American lobster, Cancer crabs, blue crab, northern shrimp, and deep-sea red crab), only deep-sea red crab did not score at least “moderate” on overall vulnerability, while all species scored “high” on the exposure component of the assessment (Hare et al. 2016).\n\nMullowney and Baker (Mullowney and Baker 2021) found that colder temperatures were a significant driver of decreases in snow crab size-at-morphometric-maturity in Newfoundland and Labrador. Conversely, an inverse relationship between size at maturity and temperature has been observed for the American lobster (Le Bris et al. 2017).\nA better understanding of size at maturity will contribute to broader work to assess the effects of climate change on regional fisheries harvest scenarios (NOAA Fisheries 2024). My project will thus support federally mandated efforts to optimize and diversify sustainable seafood production and fishing opportunities while ensuring the long-term sustainability of fisheries through effective and efficient management.\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nAudzijonyte, Asta, Anna Kuparinen, and Elizabeth A.

Achieving these goals will require ongoing scientific advancements to support adaptive fisheries management in the face of shifting ecosystem dynamics (NOAA Fisheries 2024). My research will greatly expand our ability to accurately and non-invasively estimate crustacean size at maturity. The results of this project will be directly applicable to the establishment of minimum landing sizes and the development of stock assessment models for dozens of U.S. fisheries.

    "section": "3.11 Pandalus shrimp",
    "text": "3.11 Pandalus shrimp\nThe genus Pandalus includes many species of shrimp that are economically valuable for the United States fishing industry. Commercial fishing occurs for ocean shrimp (P. jordani) off the coast of Washington, Oregon, and California, while spot shrimp (P. platyceros) are targeted throughout their geographic range from Southern California to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska (Levy et al. 2020). Other shrimp of commercial and subsistence value in Alaska include the Alaskan pink shrimp (P. eous), the humpy shrimp (P. goniurus), the humpback shrimp, (P. hypsinotus), and the sidestripe shrimp (P. dispar).\nOn the Atlantic coast, the northern shrimp (P. borealis) supported a large fishery in the Gulf of Maine for decades but is now extremely depleted and commercial fishing for northern shrimp is prohibited. Despite the fishing moratorium that has been in place since 2014, the most recent stock assessment update (December 2024) reported a continued decline in stock status, with all indices at all-time lows (Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission 2024). Although a small number of fishing industry members will be allowed to catch P. borealis in 2025 through a winter research sampling program run by the Maine Department of Marine Resources and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commmission, Draft Amendment 4 to the Fishery Management Plan suggests that it may be a long time before harvesting is permitted outside of such sampling pilots. The draft states that “given the continued poor condition of the stock, the requirement of annual specifications in the Northern Shrimp FMP may no longer be appropriate” and proposes lengthening specification timelines to allow for multi-year moratoriums (Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission 2025).\nPandalus species are difficult to model using traditional stock assessment methods because they are protandric sequential hermaphrodites; i.e., they reproduce as males before changing sex to become female (Bergström 2000). Along with the size at which the sex transition occurs, their growth rate, recruitment dynamics, and natural mortality can be highly sensitive to changes in environmental conditions (Chang, Richards, and Chen 2021; Hansen and Aschan 2000; Perry, Boutillier, and Foreman 2000; Hannah 2011). Rather than including a size at 50% maturity (SM50) parameter, current P. borealis stock assessment models include a parameter \\(L_{50_{sex}} (y)\\), the length at which 50% of shrimp change sex to females in year y (Drouineau et al. 2012; Cao, Chen, and Richards 2017a). A statistical catch-at-length model model that includes environmental variables (Cao, Chen, and Richards 2017a, 2017b) utilizing such a sex change function is now preferentially used for P. borealis management over catch-survey analysis (CSA) and Age Structured Assessment Program (ASAP) models used in previous analyses (Cadrin et al. 1999; Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission 2021, 2018). The notable plasticity of \\(L_{50_{sex}}\\) in Pandalus means that it is useful as an indicator of population status; for example, comparing annual \\(L_{50_{sex}}\\) values to established baselines is an important component of the management of the P. platyceros and P. hypsinotus fisheries in Southeast Alaska (Smith 2020). Because fecundity increases with size for Pandalus species, decreases in \\(L_{50_{sex}}\\) result in decreased population fecundity, which can lead to lower recruitment and further reductions in population size (Smith 2020).\nMultiparous and primiparous females can be easily differentiated by sternal spines that are only present in females who have not previously spawned (McCrary 1971). This criterion was used by Skúladóttir and Pétursson to calculate median length at maturity for P. borealis (an example of determining SM50 based on functional maturity) in the Denmark Strait, finding geographic variation in SM50 between three different areas in the waters around Iceland (Skúladóttir 1998; Skúladóttir and Pétursson 1999). In conjunction with the general hermaphroditic structure of their life history, this means that morphometric maturity is not generally a highly relevant notion for Pandalus shrimps. However, morphometric analyses have been used to discriminate between populations of P. borealis from different Icelandic fjords (Jónsdóttir, Guðlaugsdóttir, and Karlsson 2016).\nIn summary, although size at maturity and morphometric analysis are separately important for Pandalus, size at morphometric maturity does not appear to be relevant for the U.S. fisheries for species within the genus.",

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nThe foundation of my dissertation will be a systematic literature review to identify all modeling approaches used to estimate crustacean size at maturity using morphometric data. Special focus will be placed on understanding the methodologies of studies that have investigated regional/spatial variation in size at maturity. I will aim to follow current best practices for ensuring transparency and reproducibility in ecological systematic reviews and meta-analyses (Foo et al. 2021; O’Dea et al. 2021; Kambouris et al. 2024; Gates 2002; Koricheva, Gurevitch, and Mengersen 2013).\nSynthesis research plays a crucial role in accelerating ecological knowledge by integrating evidence and organizing information in a way that can answer foundational, large-scale questions (Halpern et al. 2020; Spake et al. 2022). The combined analysis of disparate data sources, theories, and tools is a powerful tool for advancing scientific understanding, and represents a powerful approach to informing evidence-based management decisions in the face of rapid environmental change (Halpern et al. 2020; Koricheva, Gurevitch, and Mengersen 2013). The results from qualitative and, where possible, quantitative/meta-analytical methods applied to a novel database of size at maturity studies will be invaluable for preventing the remainder of my graduate work from duplicating existing efforts and maximizing the scientific value of my research output. Additionally, given the relative impact of synthesis papers compared to non-synthesis papers, publishing a rigorous systematic review will be highly beneficial for establishing my presence as a promising researcher within the fisheries science community.",

Based on the overlap between the databases recommended for use by these studies and the databases to which I have institutional access, I decided to use Scopus, JSTOR, and ProQuest. Although the merits of Google Scholar as a tool for systematic reviews may be somewhat contentious (Boeker, Vach, and Motschall 2013; Giustini and Boulos 2013), it contains many records that are not found in other databases and is a powerful tool to find grey literature and increase the coverage of multi-database searches (Haddaway et al. 2015; Gusenbauer 2019; Martín-Martín et al. 2021). I only included the first 500 results out of 686 returned from Google Scholar (the first 25 pages). This is beyond the threshold of 50-100 results included by many systematic reviewers (Haddaway et al. 2015), and results beyond that appeared to have low relevance to the focal question. I also searched the NOAA Institutional Repository, another excellent source of grey literature, and did preliminary searches of Github and Zenodo to identify code/software developed for size at maturity modeling. Additionally, many additional relevant sources were identified through snowball searching and while reading scientific articles and management documents (e.g., stock assessment reports) (Table 4.2).\n\n\n\nTable 4.2: Databases used for systematic review\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase\n# of results\nSearch field\nNotes\n\n\n\nJSTOR\n33\nAbstracts only\n\n\n\nScopus\n332\nAbstract, title, keywords\n\n\n\nProQuest\n49\nAnywhere but full text\nProQuest One Academic (includes ProQuest Central and ProQuest Dissertation & Theses Global.

For Google Scholar, the search query used was: intitle:((“maturity” AND “size”) AND (“crab” OR “Crustacea” OR “Decapoda” OR “Brachyura”)). The query used for all other databases was: (morpho* AND “maturity” AND “size”) AND (“crab” OR “Crustacea” OR “Decapoda” OR “Brachyura”). The search string was tested with a preliminary Scopus search to ensure that it could find two articles that were highly relevant to the project: Olsen and Stevens (2020) and Lawrence et al. (2021).\nDuplicates were first removed using the duplicate merging feature in the reference manager software Zotero. A second round of duplicate screening was conducted using the online systematic review software Rayyan, which was then used for the initial screening of titles and abstracts. In some cases, the full text was briefly skimmed to resolve uncertainties about whether the study should be included that resulted from absent or ambiguous descriptions in the abstract of the method of determining size at maturity. The primary reason for exclusion was that the study determined physiological or functional maturity rather than morphometric maturity (Waiho et al. 2017). Another common category of excluded studies were those using morphometric analysis for a purpose other than determining size at maturity, such as to distinguish two species, compare populations within a species, or identify the biological effects of an external variable like temperature or predation. At least 70 studies were focused on the general morphology and/or size at maturity of a non-crustacean organism, particularly skates, rays, and marine snails.",

One will be in “wide” format with one row for each paper/source. The Parameters and Species tables will be in long/stacked format, with one row for each relevant grouping included in a source.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: The data collected during the systematic review will be recorded in a structured database to facilitate statistical analysis and model-fitting as well as reuse and expansion by future researchers. Each row in the first table is a unique study, with columns representing 59 study-level variables. The second table contains individual parameter records, for which there may be multiple within a given study (e.g., separate SM50 estimates for males and females). Finally, a third table contains information about each crustacean species included in the review, enabling me to identify relationships between maturity parameters and other life history characteristics of the species and to include phylogenetic correlations in the meta-analytical models.\n\n\nAttributes (variables) that will be recorded in the tables corresponding to Figure 4.1 are provided in Appendix B in EML format, while supporting tables are in Appendix C. The first supporting table contains factor codes in accordance with the EML schema. The second supporting table contains standardized descriptions of each measured body part to mitigate confusion resulting from the usage of general terms like “claw height”. Similarly, a third table contains standardized descriptions of each modeling approach to mitigate confusion resulting from the usage of general terms like “piecewise regression”.\nAdditional information regarding the storage and accessibility of these data is available in Appendix A.",

Sampling dates and year of publication will be used to establish a timeline of key developments in this area and describe how methods of estimating SM50 using morphometric data have changed over time.\nMost factor variables will be summarized by calculating the proportion of included studies for which the variable was coded TRUE: for example, if the study also recorded physiological maturity, if the study included a measure of variance for their SM50 estimate, or if the study mentioned excluding individuals with regenerating chelae.\nMore complex meta-analytical models will be fit as Bayesian multilevel mixed models, likely using brms with packages like tidybayes, ggdist, bayestestR or bayesplot for visualizing posterior distributions, trace plots, and other relevant graphics. These models will include phylogenetic correlation matrices and can account for non-independence when multiple effect sizes are obtained from the same study. Where sufficient phylogenetic data are available, I will employ the powerful multilevel comparative meta-analysis approach described by Pottier et al.

    "text": "5.1 Morphometric Maturity: When and Why?\nUsing changes in the relative growth of the claws or abdomen as a sign of the onset of sexual maturity is complicated by the multitude of ecological and evolutionary factors that work together to shape crustacean claw and abdomen morphology. This section will focus on the ecological and evolutionary context of crustacean morphometric maturity.\nAlthough changes in morphometry have been successfully linked to sexual maturity and used to estimate SM50 in many crustacean species, other studies have found no distinct changes in claw or abdomen growth rates at maturity.\nThis line of inquiry has management implications because it can inform how resources are allocated when researchers are attempting to estimate SM50 for a new species. If it seems unlikely that the onset of maturity for males of the species will exhibit discontinuous growth of the chelae, it may not be an efficient use of time and money to measure the chelae of thousands of individuals.\nOther questions and hypotheses that may be addressed include:\nThere are many interesting opportunities for comparative phylogenetics surrounding this topic. For example, carapace morphometrics have been used to identify morphological convergence events within the family of primarily symbiotic pea crabs (Pinnotheridae) (Hultgren, Foxx, and Palacios Theil 2022; Gier et al. 2023). Initial analyses of carapace aspect ratio (AR, the ratio of carapace width to carapace length) found that correlations between carapace AR and host identity remained even after statistically accounting for phylogeny, indicating repeated evolution to specific host associations across the extensive pea crab phylogenetic tree(Hultgren, Foxx, and Palacios Theil 2022). This idea has been corroborated by later research linking phylogenetic position and preferred host phyla to landmark-based carapace morphology (Gier et al. 2023) Along with earlier work on pea crab ecomorphology (Gier and Becker 2020), these studies illustrate how integrating morphological, ecological, and molecular data can reveal strong evolutionary patterns within a subset of Crustacea.",

    "text": "5.2 Claws\n\n5.2.1 Feeding & movement\nDiet-induced plasticity\nThere is a large body of evidence that differences in diet-related exercise can affect claw size and shape within the lifespan of an individual crab as well as between individuals and populations. Changes in claw morphology are associated with ontogenetic shifts in diet for both marine and freshwater crabs (Lim, Yong, and Christy 2016; Viozzi et al. 2021). Smith and Palmer (1994) found significant differences in claw size and performance between C. productus individuals raised on experimental diets of varying levels of toughness, concluding that claw morphology is affected by differential use. Analogous results have been found for green crabs (C. maenas) raised on a diet of winkles (hard prey) compared to a diet of soft fish flesh (Abby-Kalio and Warner 1984).\nReasons for differences between species/population chela size or shape\n\nDiet consists of different prey species: crabs with larger chelae can consume a wider size range of hard-bodied prey items and can thus exploit a wider spectrum of prey species (Lee and Seed 1992)\nDiet consists of the same prey species, but there are population differences in prey morphology (e.g., a high correlation between C. maenas crusher claw size and L. obtusata shell mass) (Edgell and Rochette 2008)\nGeographic differentiation was only observable in the C. maenas crusher claw, not the cutter claw, and occurred in both sexes, indicating a trophic function (Smith 2004)\nDifferences in food availability (e.g., food resource concentrations, foraging opportunities) influence the energy available for claw growth (McLain and Pratt 2010)\n\n5.2.2 Sexual selection\nAggression/intrasexual competition\nIn some species, it appears that claw morphology has evolved for effectiveness in male-male competition rather than selection by female mating preferences (Callander et al. 2013). Responses of male C. maenas to conspecific male competitors were strongly influenced by relative chela size, while body size had a comparatively weak effect (Lee and Seed 1992). The role of cheliped size in decisions to initiate contests and in determining the outcome of those contests has also been demonstrated across a number of hermit crab species (Yasuda and Koga 2016; Yoshino, Koga, and Oki 2011). In fact, examples of the importance of claw morphology in intrasexual competition can be found in essentially all branches of the crustacean phylogenetic tree. The arched morphology of squat lobster chelae appears to have evolved to inflict puncture wounds on opponents during agonistic interactions (Claverie and Smith 2007). Crayfish with experimentally impaired chelae were displaced from optimal shelter locations by unimpaired conspecifics (Levenbach and Hazlett 1996). Chela development and differentiation has been especially well-studied for the American lobster (Homarus americanus). As early as 1935, Templeman noted that the outcome of a physical contest between two male lobsters of similar shell hardness was generally determined by the size of their large chelae (Templeman 1935).\nHowever, this phenomenon is by no means universal: for example, the dotillid crab Scopimera globosa does not use its chelae to grasp or strike during male-male combat, instead predominantly using its walking legs during wrestling matches (Ida and Wada 2017). Accordingly, Ida and Wada (2017) found that leg length had a significant impact on S. globosa fighting success, but carapace width and chela length did not.\nMating/copulation/signaling to females\n\nMales in mating pairs of C. maenas had significantly larger chelae than the total male population (Lee and Seed 1992).\n\n5.2.3 Physiological constraints\n\nMechanical advantage does not always decline with increasing claw length (Taylor 2001; Dennenmoser and Christy 2013). The optimal claw shape for signaling females is in opposition to the optimal shape for fighting, like the sexual selection vs. locomotion conflict, but Dennenmoser and Christy (2013) found that claw physiology and male fighting tactics compensate for the selective pressure for effective signals such that the claw remains a potent weapon (Allen and Levinton 2007; Dennenmoser and Christy 2013). However, muscle stress (force per unit area) generally declines with increasing claw size, leading Taylor (2001) to suggest that the positive allometric shifts in claw size observed in male decapod crustaceans may be needed to compensate for the declining muscle stress in order to maintain a constant force output per unit body size. \nEnergetic and lomotion-related costs + increased predation risk: for example, treadmill endurance capacity was significantly lower for fiddler crabs with intact claws compared to those without (Allen and Levinton 2007). Fiddler crab sprint velocity was shown to increase following autonomy when running on a flat surface (Martin 2019). Coevolution of leg morphology may help mitigate such locomotor and energetic costs of bearing enlarged chelae, as demonstrated by Bywater et al. (2018) in a genus-wide study of fiddler crabs. In other crustaceans, lactate levels (an indicator of fatigue) were positively related to cheliped size in the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus (Doake, Scantlebury, and Elwood 2010). Swimming speed was negatively correlated with chela size for the crayfish Cherax dispar (Wilson et al. 2009).\n\n5.2.4 Abiotic & other\n\nHabitat/substrate type (Marochi, Masunari, and Schubart 2017; McLain and Pratt 2010)\n\nTemperature differences\n\nThere is evidence that the major claw serves a thermoregulatory function for the fiddler crab and may allow them to occupy a broader range of thermal niches (Darnell, Munguia, and Benkman 2011; De Grande, Fogo, and Costa 2021).\n\n\nCannibalism (Dutil et al. 2000)\nHarvest-induced evolution was observed in the European lobster (Homarus gammarus) as a result of the selective pressure against large chelae exerted by the fishery (Tonje K. Sørdalen et al. 2018). However, in a follow-up study, Sørdalen et al. (2020) showed that marine protected areas (MPAs) may partially restore trait loss, with males inside MPAs possessing larger claws than similarly-sized males in nearby fished areas.\nSeasonal variation (Yasuda et al. 2017)",

    "text": "6.1 Introduction\nTesting a proposed model against simulated data generated from a known underlying process is an important but sometimes overlooked step in ecological research (Austin et al. 2006; Lotterhos, Fitzpatrick, and Blackmon 2022). In fisheries science, simulation testing is commonly used to evaluate stock assessment and population dynamic models and assess their robustness to various types of error (Deroba et al. 2015; Piner et al. 2011).\nBefore applying the size-at-maturity estimation procedures identified through the systematic review to real data, I will create multiple simulated data sets with differing characteristics in order to determine the domains of applicability and inference of each model. The domain of applicability refers to the types of data sets to which a model can reliably be applied, while the domain of inference is defined as the processes or conclusions that can be inferred from the model output (Lotterhos, Fitzpatrick, and Blackmon 2022). The methodology for this chapter will be heavily influenced by the principles for ecological simulation testing outlined by Lotterhos et al. (2022) and the guidelines for computational method benchmarking developed by Weber et al. (2019) (See Box 1).",

    "text": "6.2 Basic simulation steps\n\nCreate a normal distribution of the body size variable\nCalculate probability of maturity for each individual based on body size\nCalculate predicted claw or abdomen size based on body size\nAdd error\n\nThe fake_crustaceans function in morphmat allows users to rapidly generate many data sets with options for changing parameters in each of the four steps.\nIn more detail:\n\nCreate a normal distribution of the body size variable with the specified mean and SD. The fake_crustaceans default is to generate a random sample of 1000 crustaceans with a mean carapace width/body size of 105 mm and standard deviation of 20 mm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Histogram of carapace widths\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a logistic distribution with known location and scale parameters (i.e., known L50 and steepness of the logistic curve) to find the probability of maturity for each individual based on their body size. The fake_crustaceans default is for the true size at maturity for the population to be 100 mm, with a slope parameter for the logistic equation of 5.\n\nThe parameterization of the logistic equation we will use is: \\[f(x)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(x-a)/b}} \\] where \\(a\\) is a location parameter and \\(b\\) is the shape parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Distribution of carapace widths by maturity level\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing given parameters for the slope and intercept of the allometric equation, find the predicted chela height for each individual based on their carapace width.\n\nThe allometric growth equation is \\begin{equation}Y=\\beta X^{\\alpha},\\end{equation}\nwhich results in a linear plot when log-transformed: \\(\\log{(Y)}= \\tilde\\beta+\\alpha \\log{(X)}\\). Here, \\(\\alpha\\) is the slope of the allometric line and \\(\\beta\\) is the intercept, with \\(\\tilde{\\beta}=\\log{(\\beta)}\\). Differences in the intercept of the allometry indicate differences in the proportionate size of the chela, irrespective of carapace width. In contrast, differences in the slope parameter represent differences in how the relative size of the chela changes with body size.\nThe fake_crustaceans default is no change in the allometric slope or intercept parameters \\((\\alpha=1.2, \\beta=0.1)\\) upon reaching maturity, so if this was real data, we would not actually be able to estimate size at maturity based on a change in morphometric ratios. The SD of the error distribution also remains constant upon reaching maturity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Carapace width vs. chela height using the default simulation parameters. Vertical grey lines represent the size at maturity used in the logistic equation (100 mm).\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd error representing individual variation in allometric growth. Errors added in Step 4 are assumed to be normally distributed around the regression lines obtained by log-transforming the raw CW and CH values. In other words, the data are assumed to have multiplicative log-normally distributed error:\n\n\\[Y=\\beta X^{\\alpha}e^{\\varepsilon}, \\quad \\varepsilon \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\] \\[\\log{(Y)}=\\log{(\\beta)}+ \\alpha\\log{(X)}+\\varepsilon, \\quad \\varepsilon \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\]\nThe question of whether error structures should be assumed to be multiplicative or additive when fitting allometric models is non-trivial and often controversial (Packard 2009; Ballantyne 2013; Xiao et al. 2011). However, the assumption of multiplicative error is often appropriate for biological contexts and in this case, simulating error based on a multiplicative structure generates artificial data sets that adequately resemble the empirical morphometric data sets we are interested in (Xiao et al. 2011; Kerkhoff and Enquist 2009). Variance in empirical size-at-maturity data often appears higher for mature individuals, so by assuming a multiplicative error structure, these errors will be proportional to the x-axis variable. For example, a measurement error of 4 mm would be less likely to occur when measuring a crab with a carapace that is 30 mm in length (a 13% error) than for a crab with a 100-mm carapace (a 4% error). Alternative error distributions for allometric models continue to be developed, and future extensions of our research could consider the performance of various size-at-maturity models when applied to simulated data with different forms of error (Echavarría-Heras et al. 2024).",

The collection of parameter sets will include some extreme combinations that represent challenging or “adversarial” data sets.

If not already included, very popular methods (namely, segmented, regrans, and Somerton’s method) will also be included in the second round of testing. The second round of simulation testing will include changing the location of SM50 within the range of the data, the logistic slope parameter, the allometric growth parameters, and the level of error/noise in the data.\n\n7.2.1 Logistic slope parameter\nThe slope of the logistic distribution becomes less steep with higher values of \\(a\\). The lower values are representative of a species where there is very little intraspecific variation in size at maturity; if the true L50 is 100 mm, almost all individuals will become mature close to 100 mm. In contrast, the high parameters represent a species where there is significant variation in L50 between individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Probability of maturity function with varying slope parameters. The vertical dashed line represents the size at maturity/inflection point/location parameter, which is set to 100 mm.\n\n\n\n\nAnother way of visualizing the impact of changing the slope parameter \\((a)\\) is by comparing density plots of maturity by CW. Figure 7.2 illustrates how the area of intersection between the immature and mature curves increases with increasing values of \\(a\\).

Instead of leaving the slope parameter at 5, we will try values from 1 to 10. Values above 10 were initially tested, but the degree of overlap between the mature and immature groups was far beyond what is likely to be observed in nature. We will test five different options for how allometric growth changes upon reaching maturity, including the default of no change. We will test three options for the magnitude of the errors. The three options will be a normal distribution with an extremely small SD (essentially no error), a SD equal to 1/20 the range of the x-axis variable, or a SD of 1/15 the range of the x-axis variable.

    "text": "References\nR has become a foundational tool for quantitative fisheries research, with specialized packages such as FSA, ggFishPlots, and ss3sim enhancing the functionality of base R and more generalized packages to provide fisheries scientists with an ever-growing toolbox for data analysis and visualization. I will create an open-source R package, morphmat, which will allow fisheries scientists and managers to implement the multitude of modeling approaches identified through my synthesis research. The package will include user-friendly functions for estimating size at morphometric maturity, along with guidelines for choosing the optimal method for a given dataset and correctly interpreting results. Both novel and historically popular (e.g., broken-stick regression) methods will be included, and users will be able to obtain SM50 estimates from over a dozen different approaches with a single function call. Crucially, by combining code for the various models within a single package, morphmat will represent the first software tool enabling the application of multi-model inference to SM50 estimation, avoiding the arbitrary selection of a single “best” model (Katsanevakis 2006; Grueber et al. 2011) By increasing the accessibility of modern statistical methods for estimating SM50, I hope to facilitate the widespread adoption of improved SM50 modeling procedures.\nI will follow the best practices for package development described by Wickham and Bryan (2023), including comprehensive function documentation with illustrative examples, informative package metadata, and automated (unit) testing (Wickham 2011). I will also refer to the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles) when developing and sharing morphmat(Barker et al. 2022) and generate appropriate metadata using the CodeMeta format (https://codemeta.github.io/).\nIn conjunction with vignettes included in the package, a morphmat website (built using pkgdown and GitHub pages) will host more detailed articles explaining how to use the package. The pkgdown articles will allow me to show how morphmat can work in concert with large packages like glmmTMB without requiring those packages to be added as formal dependencies. Additionally, articles can include many more (and more complex) graphics than it would be feasible to include within a vignette. The current version of the website can be found here: https://rmk118.github.io/morphmat/\nAs well as submitting morphmat to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), I will ensure that morphmat meets the rOpenSci guidelines for inclusion in their suite of packages. I will submit morphmat to rOpenSci for software peer review, during which two reviewers will provide feedback on the quality, documentation, and clarity of the package. In addition to receiving useful feedback from experienced developers, submitting a package to rOpenSci will allow me to receive support with ongoing maintenance issues such as those associated with updates to R, dependencies, and CRAN policies, as well as promotion of the package on various social media platforms (Anderson et al. 2024).\nAcceptance into the rOpenSci repository generally results in a fast-tracked review process for accompanying manuscripts submitted to the Journal of Open Source Software. Having a published manuscript describing morphmat will maximize the potential for widespread adoption by fisheries scientists and other biologists interested in size at maturity determination. I also hope that morphmat could be included in more domain-specific repositories, such as the NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox or the fishR collection of packages, which would provide additional exposure to potential users who could benefit from these tools.",

    "section": "10.2 Methods",
    "text": "10.2 Methods\nBased on the superior performance of mclust during the preliminary simulation testing, my current plan for analyzing the Jonah crab data is to use Gaussian mixture models for classification followed by spatial logistic regression to determine SM50. This may change as I find new modeling approaches through the systematic review and conduct more comprehensive simulation testing.\n\n10.2.1 Jonah crab data\nMale Jonah crab morphological data used in this study were collected across the Northeast Atlantic in 2015-2019 and 2021. Most data were obtained from the annual Northeast Fisheries Science Center bottom trawl surveys, with supplemental measurements provided by the Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries and the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science in 2015, 2016, and 2017. We only considered records that included a measurement for both carapace width (CW) and chela height (CH) and had spatial coordinates. Although there is also some data for female Jonah crabs, females are uncommon in the Jonah crab fishery because they are typically below the minimum legal size limit and associated trap vent sizes.\n\n\n10.2.2 Mixture model clustering\nI will use the package mclust to perform model-based clustering using finite Gaussian mixture models (Scrucca et al. 2023). In brief, this clustering method works by assuming that the groups (in this case, mature and immature crabs) correspond to different probability density functions, called mixture components. The overall mixture distribution is a weighted sum (formally, a convex linear combination) of these components. The parameters for the component distributions and the mixture weights are estimated using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, an iterative approach to finding maximum-likelihood estimates that is commonly used for latent variable and missing data problems (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977).\nThe data will not be manually transformed before clustering because the mclust default is to transform the data using singular value decomposition (SVD) before initializing the EM algorithm (Scrucca and Raftery 2015). The number of clusters will be pre-specified \\((G=2)\\). The “EVV” type will be chosen to specify the geometric characteristics of the covariance matrices, meaning that the mixture components have equal volume but varying shape and orientation (Scrucca et al. 2023).\n\n\n10.2.3 Spatial logistic regression\nThe clustering-derived maturity labels will then used to fit a logistic regression model using the R package sdmTMB version 0.6.0.9013, which provides a flexible interface to fit spatial and spatiotemporal GLMMs (Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models) (Anderson et al., n.d.). The package employs Template Model Builder (TMB) and integrated nested Laplace approximations to find values for fixed effects that maximize the marginal log likelihood while integrating across random effects (Kristensen et al. 2016; Rue, Martino, and Chopin 2009). A Delaunay triangulation mesh will be constructed over the observed coordinates using the make_mesh function in sdmTMB, setting a minimum distance of 10 km to avoid overfitting. The mesh serves as an input for an sdmTMB logistic model (binomial family with a logit link) of the form maturity ~ CW, with a spatially-varying slope coefficient for carapace width added as a random effect. I will use the model to generate predictions over a grid of the target region and extracted the value of the coefficient for each location, then use the extracted coefficient to recalculate SM50 at each point. I will model spatial variation in the probability of maturity at legal size by generating model predictions over a grid that included CW as a constant attribute held at the minimum legal size.\nFor comparison with the spatial model, I will fit a non-spatial logistic model using the base R function glm(). The Fieller method will be used to extract confidence intervals for SM50 from the GLM coefficients and variance-covariance matrix (Mainguy et al. 2024). Comparison between models will be based on differences between their Akaike information criterion (AIC) values (Burnham and Anderson 2004). Analytical randomized-quantile residuals will be checked for normality (Dunn and Smyth 1996) and simulation-based residuals from the fitted models will be checked for uniformity, overdispersion, and the presence of significant outliers using the R package DHARMa (Hartig, n.d.).",

Datasets will be generated based on different combinations of parameters describing the population and sampling procedure, including mean carapace width, sample size, and sharpness of the transition to maturity.\nSystematic review: For each source included in the systematic review, information will be extracted for 62 separate variables related to the context, methodology, and conclusions of the study. An EML-formatted attribute table of these variables is provided in Appendix B. The temporal range of the sources included in the review will be 1935 to present. No geographic limitations will be imposed.\nSensitivity: Data generated during the course of the project are expected to be either simulated or collected from publicly-available sources (e.g., published scientific literature). Thus, there are not expected to be sensitivity concerns or a need for data access limitations or restrictions.",

    "text": "A.3 Standards to be used for data/metadata format and content\nData management for this project will be guided by the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles for data management. Output will be available in non-proprietary and machine-readable file formats (.csv) for sharing and archiving to maximize the potential for reuse and longevity. Metadata will be formatted according to the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) schema, a comprehensive and flexible XML metadata standard widely used for environmental and ecological data. EML is highly interoperable and uses internationally recognized standards such as ORCID, the ISO 8601 Date and Time standard, and ITIS for authoritative taxonomic IDs. Data dictionaries (descriptions of each column/variable in a data table) will be generated in tabular format and downloaded as .csv files for conversion into “attributeList” objects within the EML schema.",

    "text": "A.4 Methods for providing data stewardship, access, and preservation\nDuring the analysis, data will be stored in at least three separate locations to minimize the potential for data loss. The systematic review data will be compiled in a cloud-based Google Sheet and regularly downloaded as a .csv file that is uploaded to the GitHub repository associated with the project and saved to an external hard drive. Similarly, the simulation output (saved as .csv files) will be available in a GitHub repository and uploaded to Google Drive and saved to an external hard drive. Data will be deposited in the data repository Zenodo, providing public access and permanent archiving. Through Zenodo, each dataset will be assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to unambiguously identify the data and facilitate data citation. When appropriate, I will also append my data as supplemental files in reports and publications.\nThe R scripts used to analyze the data will be made available alongside the data itself, and I will follow best practices to ensure the reproducibility of my code. Such practices include avoiding absolute file paths, using meaningful file names and file hierarchies, implementing modular code through the use of custom functions, and intuitive variable naming. Where appropriate, I will use Quarto documents to combine text, code, and output into a single file.",
