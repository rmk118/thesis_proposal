    "text": "1.1 Summary\nAccurate estimates of size at maturity are crucial for the effective management of marine crustaceans, which represent the most valuable group of wild-capture fisheries by landed mass. Size at maturity values often influence the establishment of minimum landing sizes and represent crucial inputs in widely-used stock assessment models. For many crustaceans, size at maturity can be observed through changes in the relative size and growth of the chelae (males) or abdomen (females), referred to as a transition to morphometric maturity. Morphometric maturity is often a better indicator of functional maturity (i.e., the ability to successfully mate and produce offspring) than physiological maturity, which generally must be determined through gonad dissection or similarly invasive methods. Over the past century, various methods have been developed to estimate size at morphometric maturity for hundreds of crustacean species across the globe. Despite their widespread use, there has been limited research comparing the accuracy of these methods, and many researchers are unaware of more recently developed approaches to modeling size at maturity using morphometric data. My proposed thesis will address these gaps by comprehensively evaluating all documented approaches to modeling size at morphometric maturity and developing tools to facilitate the adoption of sound quantitative methods by fisheries scientists and managers.",

    "text": "1.2 Proposed Structure\nI propose that my dissertation will contain at least five chapters, organized under three main headings: synthesis research (literature reviews and meta-analyses), quantitative methods (simulation testing and R package development), and applications to specific crustacean species (Table 1.1).\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Proposed structure of PhD dissertation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesis\nCh. 1\nA systematic review of the use of morphometric data to determine crustacean size at maturity\n\n\nSynthesis\nCh. 2\nEcological and evolutionary drivers of changes in crab (Brachyura) allometry at maturity\n\n\nQuantitative methods\nCh. 3\nA guide to determining crustacean size at maturity from morphometric data (simulation testing)\n\n\nQuantitative methods\nCh. 4\nmorphmat: An R package to Model Size at Maturity Using Morphometric Data\n\n\nApplications\nCh. 5\nModeling spatial variation in Jonah crab size at maturity\n\n\nApplications\nCh. 6\nTBD additional collaborations/applications. May be research output from PhD but not formally included in dissertation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy proposed chapters are thematically connected and build upon one another in a natural progression. Chapter 1 will focus on identifying the modeling approaches (e.g., various types of piecewise regression and clustering) used to estimate size at maturity and will examine the context in which they are applied and the conclusions drawn from the given application. Chapter 2 will use the comprehensive dataset compiled in Chapter 1 to identify how changes in morphometry may be correlated with the life history traits, ecological niches, and evolutionary trajectories of different crustacean species. Chapter 3 will use simulation testing to evaluate the performance of the models identified in Chapter 1 when applied to artificial datasets with known size at maturity values. The simulation testing will allow me to determine how accurately each model can recover the true parameters when presented with realistic challenges like small sample sizes, underrepresentation of smaller individuals, and high variability/error in the data.\nChapter 4 describes an open-source R package I am developing that will contain easy-to-implement functions for researchers to implement the modeling approaches identified and tested in the previous chapters. Finally, the Applications section will demonstrate the value of this research by using the best practices I identify in Chapter 3 to model size at maturity for specific crustacean species. At a minimum, this will include a chapter modeling spatial variation in Jonah crab (Cancer borealis) size at maturity, illustrating how the workflows discussed under the Quantitative Methods heading can be extended to incorporate spatially-structured or time series data. However, I have identified numerous potential avenues to apply this work in collaboration with external researchers (Table 1.2), and undoubtedly more will arise over the course of my graduate studies.\n\n\n\nTable 1.2: Example extensions/applications of the topics discussed in the main chapters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\nPotential collaborators\n\n\n\nIdentifying regenerating chelae when analyzing crustacean morphometrics\nJason Goldstein (Wells NERR, UNH), Joshua Carloni (NH F&G)\n\n\nClimate impacts on size at morphometric maturity for Atlantic crustacean fisheries\nKathy Mills, Michelle Staudinger, Bernard Sainte-Marie\n\n\nInforming Jonah crab and American lobster population models and stock assessments\nMiguel Barajas, Jesica Waller, Everett Rzeszowski, Andrew Goode, Cameron Hodgdon\n\n\nMorphometric vs. physiological maturity of the Chesapeake Bay blue crab\nZach Olsen (Texas PWD), VIMS/UMCES (Alexandra Schneider)",

Based on the overlap between the databases recommended for use by these studies and the databases to which I have institutional access, I decided to use Scopus, JSTOR, and ProQuest. Although the merits of Google Scholar as a tool for systematic reviews may be somewhat contentious (Boeker, Vach, and Motschall 2013; Giustini and Boulos 2013), it contains many records that are not found in other databases and is a powerful tool to find grey literature and increase the coverage of multi-database searches (Haddaway et al. 2015; Gusenbauer 2019; Martín-Martín et al. 2021). I only included the first 500 results out of 686 returned from Google Scholar (the first 25 pages). This is beyond the threshold of 50-100 results included by many systematic reviewers (Haddaway et al. 2015), and results beyond that appeared to have low relevance to the focal question. I also searched the NOAA Institutional Repository, another excellent source of grey literature, and did preliminary searches of Github and Zenodo to identify code/software developed for size at maturity modeling. Additionally, many additional relevant sources were identified through snowball searching and while reading scientific articles and management documents (e.g., stock assessment reports) (Table 2.2).\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Databases used for systematic review\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase\n# of results\nSearch field\nNotes\n\n\n\nJSTOR\n33\nAbstracts only\n\n\n\nScopus\n332\nAbstract, title, keywords\n\n\n\nProQuest\n49\nAnywhere but full text\nProQuest One Academic (includes ProQuest Central and ProQuest Dissertation & Theses Global.

The query used for all other databases was: (morpho* AND “maturity” AND “size”) AND (“crab” OR “Crustacea” OR “Decapoda” OR “Brachyura”). The search string was tested with a preliminary Scopus search to ensure that it could find two articles that were highly relevant to the project: Olsen and Stevens (2020) and Lawrence et al. (2021).\nDuplicates were first removed using the duplicate merging feature in the reference manager software Zotero. A second round of duplicate screening was conducted using the online systematic review software Rayyan, which was then used for the initial screening of titles and abstracts. In some cases, the full text was briefly skimmed to resolve uncertainties about whether the study should be included that resulted from absent or ambiguous descriptions in the abstract of the method of determining size at maturity. The primary reason for exclusion was that the study determined physiological or functional maturity rather than morphometric maturity (Waiho et al. 2017). Another common category of excluded studies were those using morphometric analysis for a purpose other than determining size at maturity, such as to distinguish two species, compare populations within a species, or identify the biological effects of an external variable like temperature or predation. At least 70 studies were focused on the general morphology and/or size at maturity of a non-crustacean organism, particularly skates, rays, and marine snails.\nA small number of studies were excluded because they were written in a language other than English. Although not considering non-English studies can introduce bias into systematic reviews, some authors have found excluding non-English papers has a minimal effect on the overall conclusions of evidence syntheses (Vickers et al. 1998; Nussbaumer-Streit et al. 2020; Jüni et al. 2002). Additionally, one of the major arguments against excluding non-English studies is that it skews the geographical provenance of the body of evidence under consideration towards Europe and North America (Walpole 2019). The &gt;500 English studies retained for future screening represented a wide geographic distribution, and nearly all non-English studies were conducted in a region already represented by multiple English studies.",

    "text": "References\nR has become a foundational tool for quantitative fisheries research, with specialized packages such as FSA, ggFishPlots, and ss3sim enhancing the functionality of base R and more generalized packages to provide fisheries scientists with an ever-growing toolbox for data analysis and visualization. I will create an open-source R package, morphmat, which will allow fisheries scientists and managers to implement the multitude of modeling approaches identified through my synthesis research. The package will include user-friendly functions for estimating size at morphometric maturity, along with guidelines for choosing the optimal method for a given dataset and correctly interpreting results. Both novel and historically popular (e.g., broken-stick regression) methods will be included, and users will be able to obtain SM50 estimates from over a dozen different approaches with a single function call. Crucially, by combining code for the various models within a single package, morphmat will represent the first software tool enabling the application of multi-model inference to SM50 estimation, avoiding the arbitrary selection of a single “best” model (Katsanevakis 2006; Grueber et al. 2011) By increasing the accessibility of modern statistical methods for estimating SM50, I hope to facilitate the widespread adoption of improved SM50 modeling procedures.\nI will follow the best practices for package development described by Wickham and Bryan (2023), including comprehensive function documentation with illustrative examples, informative package metadata, and automated (unit) testing (Wickham 2011). I will also refer to the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles) when developing and sharing morphmat. In addition to submitting morphmat to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), I will ensure that morphmat meets the rOpenSci guidelines for inclusion in their suite of packages. I plan on submitting morphmat to rOpenSci for software peer review, during which two reviewers will provide feedback on the quality, documentation, and clarity of the package.\nIn addition to receiving useful feedback from experienced developers, submitting a package to rOpenSci will allow me to receive support with ongoing maintenance issues such as those associated with updates to R, dependencies, and CRAN policies, as well as promotion of the package on various social media platforms (Anderson et al. 2024). Finally, acceptance into the rOpenSci repository generally results in a fast-tracked review process for accompanying manuscripts submitted to the Journal of Open Source Software.\nIn conjunction with vignettes included in the package and articles hosted on the morphmat website (built using pkgdown), having a published manuscript describing morphmat will maximize the potential for widespread adoption by fisheries scientists and other biologists interested in size at maturity determination. I also hope that morphmat could be included in more domain-specific repositories, such as the NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox or the fishR collection of packages, which would provide additional exposure to potential users who could benefit from these tools.",

    "text": "5.1 Morphometric Maturity: When and Why?\nUsing changes in the relative growth of the claws or abdomen as a sign of the onset of sexual maturity is complicated by the multitude of ecological and evolutionary factors that work together to shape crustacean claw and abdomen morphology. This section will focus on the ecological and evolutionary context of crustacean morphometric maturity.\nAlthough changes in morphometry have been successfully linked to sexual maturity and used to estimate SM50 in many crustacean species, other studies have found no distinct changes in claw or abdomen growth rates at maturity.\nThis line of inquiry has management implications because it can inform how resources are allocated when researchers are attempting to estimate SM50 for a new species. If it seems unlikely that the onset of maturity for males of the species will exhibit discontinuous growth of the chelae, it may not be an efficient use of time and money to measure the chelae of thousands of individuals.\nOther questions and hypotheses that may be addressed include:\nThere are many interesting opportunities for comparative phylogenetics surrounding this topic. For example, carapace morphometrics have been used to identify morphological convergence events within the family of primarily symbiotic pea crabs (Pinnotheridae) (Hultgren, Foxx, and Palacios Theil 2022; Gier et al. 2023). Initial analyses of carapace aspect ratio (AR, the ratio of carapace width to carapace length) found that correlations between carapace AR and host identity remained even after statistically accounting for phylogeny, indicating repeated evolution to specific host associations across the extensive pea crab phylogenetic tree(Hultgren, Foxx, and Palacios Theil 2022). This idea has been corroborated by later research linking phylogenetic position and preferred host phyla to landmark-based carapace morphology (Gier et al. 2023) Along with earlier work on pea crab ecomorphology (Gier and Becker 2020), these studies illustrate how integrating morphological, ecological, and molecular data can reveal strong evolutionary patterns within a subset of Crustacea.",

    "section": "5.2 Claws",
    "text": "5.2 Claws\n\n5.2.1 Feeding & movement\nDiet-induced plasticity\nThere is a large body of evidence that differences in diet-related exercise can affect claw size and shape within the lifespan of an individual crab as well as between individuals and populations. Changes in claw morphology are associated with ontogenetic shifts in diet for both marine and freshwater crabs (Lim, Yong, and Christy 2016; Viozzi et al. 2021). Smith and Palmer (1994) found significant differences in claw size and performance between C. productus individuals raised on experimental diets of varying levels of toughness, concluding that claw morphology is affected by differential use. Analogous results have been found for green crabs (C. maenas) raised on a diet of winkles (hard prey) compared to a diet of soft fish flesh (Abby-Kalio and Warner 1984).\nReasons for differences between species/population chela size or shape\n\nDiet consists of different prey species: crabs with larger chelae can consume a wider size range of hard-bodied prey items and can thus exploit a wider spectrum of prey species (Lee and Seed 1992)\nDiet consists of the same prey species, but there are population differences in prey morphology (e.g., a high correlation between C. maenas crusher claw size and L. obtusata shell mass) (Edgell and Rochette 2008)\nGeographic differentiation was only observable in the C. maenas crusher claw, not the cutter claw, and occurred in both sexes, indicating a trophic function (Smith 2004)\nDifferences in food availability (e.g., food resource concentrations, foraging opportunities) influence the energy available for claw growth (McLain and Pratt 2010)\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Sexual selection\nAggression/intrasexual competition\nIn some species, it appears that claw morphology has evolved for effectiveness in male-male competition rather than selection by female mating preferences (Callander et al. 2013). Responses of male C. maenas to conspecific male competitors were strongly influenced by relative chela size, while body size had a comparatively weak effect (Lee and Seed 1992). The role of cheliped size in decisions to initiate contests and in determining the outcome of those contests has also been demonstrated across a number of hermit crab species (Yasuda and Koga 2016; Yoshino, Koga, and Oki 2011). In fact, examples of the importance of claw morphology in intrasexual competition can be found in essentially all branches of the crustacean phylogenetic tree. The arched morphology of squat lobster chelae appears to have evolved to inflict puncture wounds on opponents during agonistic interactions (Claverie and Smith 2007). Crayfish with experimentally impaired chelae were displaced from optimal shelter locations by unimpaired conspecifics (Levenbach and Hazlett 1996). Chela development and differentiation has been especially well-studied for the American lobster (Homarus americanus). As early as 1935, Templeman noted that the outcome of a physical contest between two male lobsters of similar shell hardness was generally determined by the size of their large chelae (Templeman 1935).\nHowever, this phenomenon is by no means universal: for example, the dotillid crab Scopimera globosa does not use its chelae to grasp or strike during male-male combat, instead predominantly using its walking legs during wrestling matches (Ida and Wada 2017). Accordingly, Ida and Wada (2017) found that leg length had a significant impact on S. globosa fighting success, but carapace width and chela length did not.\nMating/copulation/signaling to females\n\nMales in mating pairs of C. maenas had significantly larger chelae than the total male population (Lee and Seed 1992).\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Physiological constraints\n\nMechanical advantage does not always decline with increasing claw length (Taylor 2001; Dennenmoser and Christy 2013). The optimal claw shape for signaling females is in opposition to the optimal shape for fighting, like the sexual selection vs. locomotion conflict, but Dennenmoser and Christy (2013) found that claw physiology and male fighting tactics compensate for the selective pressure for effective signals such that the claw remains a potent weapon (Allen and Levinton 2007; Dennenmoser and Christy 2013). However, muscle stress (force per unit area) generally declines with increasing claw size, leading Taylor (2001) to suggest that the positive allometric shifts in claw size observed in male decapod crustaceans may be needed to compensate for the declining muscle stress in order to maintain a constant force output per unit body size. \nEnergetic and lomotion-related costs + increased predation risk: for example, treadmill endurance capacity was significantly lower for fiddler crabs with intact claws compared to those without (Allen and Levinton 2007). Fiddler crab sprint velocity was shown to increase following autonomy when running on a flat surface (Martin 2019). Coevolution of leg morphology may help mitigate such locomotor and energetic costs of bearing enlarged chelae, as demonstrated by Bywater et al. (2018) in a genus-wide study of fiddler crabs. In other crustaceans, lactate levels (an indicator of fatigue) were positively related to cheliped size in the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus (Doake, Scantlebury, and Elwood 2010). Swimming speed was negatively correlated with chela size for the crayfish Cherax dispar (Wilson et al. 2009).\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Abiotic & other\n\nHabitat/substrate type (Marochi, Masunari, and Schubart 2017; McLain and Pratt 2010)\nTemperature differences\n\nThere is evidence that the major claw serves a thermoregulatory function for the fiddler crab and may allow them to occupy a broader range of thermal niches (Darnell, Munguia, and Benkman 2011; De Grande, Fogo, and Costa 2021).\n\nCannibalism (Dutil et al. 2000)\nHarvest-induced evolution was observed in the European lobster (Homarus gammarus) as a result of the selective pressure against large chelae exerted by the fishery (Tonje K. Sørdalen et al. 2018). However, in a follow-up study, Sørdalen et al. (2020) showed that marine protected areas (MPAs) may partially restore trait loss, with males inside MPAs possessing larger claws than similarly-sized males in nearby fished areas.\nSeasonal variation (Yasuda et al. 2017)\n\n\n\n\n\nAbby-Kalio, N.
